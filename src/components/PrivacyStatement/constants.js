By accessing, viewing, and sharing content from IBM Boomerang, you are consenting to the collection and tracking of your personal data including your name, geography and IBM email address and the activities you specifically executed on IBM Boomerang.

In addition, some of our software products and IBM Cloud services include technologies that allow IBM to collect certain information about the use of our products and services.

          "As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our websites and your use of our IBM Cloud services and our software products to help us gather statistics about usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience, tailor our interactions with you, and improve our products and services. We do so through the use of various technologies, including scripts, tags, Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies), Local Storage (HTML5) beacons, and 'cookies'. <h3>What are cookies and why are cookies used</h3> A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While cookies are often only used to measure website usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor's experience of a website by being associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience. Cookies are typically categorized as 'session' cookies or 'persistent' cookies. Session cookies help you navigate through the website efficiently, keeping track of your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information you have already provided during the current visit, or information needed to be able to complete a transaction. Session cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when the web browser is closed. Persistent cookies on the other hand, store user preferences for current and successive visits. They are written on your device's hard disk, and are still valid when you restart your browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. <h3>How to express privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies</h3> When visiting our websites or online services, you may have the possibility to set your preferences regarding cookies and other similar technologies by using the options and tools made available to you by either your web browser or IBM. If a cookie manager has been implemented by IBM, it will be displayed at your first visit to our website. By clicking ‘cookie preferences’ at the footer of an IBM website you can choose and change at any time which types of cookies you would like our websites and IBM Cloud services to use. You can indicate your preference for required, required and functional or required, functional and personalization cookies. Here you can also find more information on the types of cookies used. Using the cookie preferences does not result in deletion of cookies that are already on your device. You can delete cookies already on your device via the settings of your web browser. While IBM websites, online and Cloud services at this time do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as 'do not track' instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser. Look under the heading 'Tools' (or similar heading) in your particular browser for information about controlling cookies. In most instances you can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the option to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Cookies in our software products can be turned off in the product itself. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our websites' features or features of our software products and IBM Cloud services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block, turn off or otherwise reject our cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you will not be able to",
