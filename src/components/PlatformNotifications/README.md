# Notifications Component

> Connects to a websocket and pulls in "unread" notifications, as well as communicating via the websocket when a notification is "read". This component is designed to be paired with the Header component.

In the storybook, there currently does not exist the capability to mock out incoming notifications - the displayed view is what the user would see when they have zero new notifications.
