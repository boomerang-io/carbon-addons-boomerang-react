# Carbon Addons Boomerang React [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ebf40744-c9a5-4c91-a43d-e885b7e2da88/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/deploys)

[Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) addon components for Boomerang written in React. View the [Storybook](https://carbon-addons-boomerang-react.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

Install the the addons package, carbon and all of the required peer-dependencies.

Run the following command using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). Other package managers like `npm` and `yarn` work as well.

```bash
pnpm install @carbon/react @boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react axios formik react-router-dom yup
```

## Styles

You need to use Sass, as we are built on top of Carbon and import the entry style sheet for the components.  We recommend using `sass` or `sass-embedded` to compile styles. Configure as required for the bundler you are using. Tools like Vite and Create React App work without additional configuration.

```scss
// index.scss
@use "@carbon/react";
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";
```

Make sure to import this file in the JavaScript code to ensure that it is included in your bundle.

## Carbon themes

We recommend using Carbon theme functionality and the associated CSS Custom Properties in your styles. See the following example for guidance on a few common use cases.

### Default theme

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "@carbon/react";
@use '@carbon/themes';
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";

// Include theme tokens
:root {
  @include themes.theme();
}
```

### Gray 10 theme

This is how we import things in our applications. We use a number of Carbon v10 tokens so we use the compatibility g10 theme from Carbon to support both new and old values. We also use Akamai as the host for our fonts instead of self-hosting via the `$use-akamai-cdn: true` argument to the `@carbon/react` import. View the Carbon docs to see all the arguments you can pass to customize your

```scss
@use "@carbon/react" with (
  $use-akamai-cdn: true
);
@use "@carbon/themes";
@use "@carbon/react/scss/compat/themes" as compat;
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";

:root {
  @include themes.theme(compat.$g10);
}
```

> Note: The library does not currently support changing the default class prefix from `cds`.

## Boomerang theme

Using the Boomerang theme is not as straightforward unfortunately. It takes two steps.

## Step 1

Import the individual Carbon packages individually as follows:

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "sass:map";

// Carbon base styles and utilities
@use '@carbon/react/scss/config' with ($use-akamai-cdn: true);
@use '@carbon/react/scss/reset';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/motion';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/type';

// Themes
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global/themes/boomerang";
@use '@carbon/react/scss/compat/themes' as compat;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/compat/theme' with (
  $theme: map.merge(compat.$white, boomerang.$theme)
);

// More base styles, components, and component tokens
@use '@carbon/react/scss/fonts';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/grid';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/layer';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/zone';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/button/tokens' as button;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/notification/tokens' as notification;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/tag/tokens' as tag;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components';

// Addons library with use boomerang enabled
@use '@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global' with ($use-theme-boomerang: true);

// Finally include the theme to include all of the css custom properties
[data-carbon-theme="boomerang"] {
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(map.merge(button.$button-tokens, boomerang.$v11-button-tokens));
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(notification.$notification-tokens);
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(tag.$tag-tokens);
  @include theme.theme();
}
```

## Step 2

You need to set the `data-carbon-theme="boomerang"` attribute value in your app, at the highest level in the document tree as possible.

```html
<html lang="en" data-carbon-theme="boomerang"></html>
```

## Use

You can then import components in the following manner.

```js
import { UIShell } from "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react";
```

> Note: In v3 of the component library we have removed the re-exporting of all of the Carbon components.

## Version 2

Because of the potential time and difficulty in a migration to Carbon v11, we will maintain a maintenance v2 of the component library. It will recieve critical functionality and security updates. Please view the support table below.

| Release | Status | End-of-life |
| v2 | **Maintenance** | 2022-04-30 |
| v3 | **Current** | - |

## Integrating with UIShell Notifications

We use [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) to create notifications for UIShell events. If you want to also use the library in your application for notifications you must configure your `ToastContainer` component to support [multiple containers](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify#multi-container-support) via the `enableMultiContainer={true}` prop. It is _NOT_ required to include a `containerId` on your container or with notifications that you create. Without multi-container support enabled, you will see two notifications created for UIShell events.

### v2

The big change here is finally supporting tree-shaking properly. This should reduce bundle size and builds times, sometimes drastically based on your use case. [View the migration guide](./documentation/guides/v2-migration.md) for updating to v2.

- Dependency updates and security fixes

**Breaking Changes**

- Move `@carbon/react/icons` to a peer dependency
