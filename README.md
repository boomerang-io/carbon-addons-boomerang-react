# Carbon Addons Boomerang React [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ebf40744-c9a5-4c91-a43d-e885b7e2da88/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/deploys)

[Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) addon components for Boomerang written in React. View the [Storybook](https://carbon-addons-boomerang-react.netlify.app/).

## Installing

Install the the addons package, carbon and all of the required peer-dependencies.

Run the following command using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). Other package managers like `npm` and `yarn` work as well.

```bash
pnpm install @carbon/react @boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react axios formik react-router-dom yup
```

Upgrading from a previous version? View our [migration guide](/docs/v3-migration.md).

## Styles

You need to use Sass, as we are built on top of Carbon and import the entry style sheet for the components. We recommend using `sass` or `sass-embedded` to compile styles. Configure as required for the bundler you are using. Tools like Vite and Create React App work without additional configuration needed.

```scss
// app.scss
@use "@carbon/react";
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";
```

Make sure to import this file in the JavaScript code to ensure that it is included in your bundle.

## Carbon themes

We recommend using Carbon theme functionality and the associated CSS custom properties in your styles to easily use Carbon theme tokens. See the following example for guidance on a couple common use cases.

### Default theme

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "@carbon/react";
@use '@carbon/themes';
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";

// Include theme tokens
:root {
  @include themes.theme();
}
```

### Gray 10 theme

This is how we import things in our applications. We use a number of Carbon v10 tokens so we use the compatibility g10 theme from Carbon to support both new and old values. We also use Akamai as the host for our fonts instead of self-hosting via the `$use-akamai-cdn: true` argument to the `@carbon/react` import. View the Carbon docs to see all the arguments you can pass to customize your

```scss
@use "@carbon/react" with (
  $use-akamai-cdn: true
);
@use "@carbon/themes";
@use "@carbon/react/scss/compat/themes" as compat;
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global";

:root {
  @include themes.theme(compat.$g10);
}
```

> Note: The library does not currently support changing the default class prefix from `cds`.

## Boomerang theme

Do you want to continue using the Boomerang theme? Unfortunately it is not as straightforward but it's not too bad. Follow the following steps

## Step 1 - Styles

Import the individual Carbon packages and addons styles as follows:

```scss
// app.scss
@use "sass:map";

// Carbon base styles and utilities
@use '@carbon/react/scss/config' with ($use-akamai-cdn: true);
@use '@carbon/react/scss/reset';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/motion';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/type';

// Themes
@use "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global/themes/boomerang";
@use '@carbon/react/scss/compat/themes' as compat;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/compat/theme' with (
  $theme: map.merge(compat.$white, boomerang.$theme)
);

// More base styles, components, and component tokens
@use '@carbon/react/scss/fonts';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/grid';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/layer';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/zone';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/button/tokens' as button;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/notification/tokens' as notification;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/tag/tokens' as tag;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components';

// Addons library with boomerang enabled
@use '@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/scss/global' with ($use-theme-boomerang: true);

// Finally include the theme to include all of the css custom properties
[data-carbon-theme="boomerang"] {
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(map.merge(button.$button-tokens, boomerang.$v11-button-tokens));
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(notification.$notification-tokens);
  @include theme.add-component-tokens(tag.$tag-tokens);
  @include theme.theme();
}
```

## Step 2 - HTLM property

You need to set the `data-carbon-theme="boomerang"` attribute value in your app, at the highest level in the document tree as possible.

```html
<html lang="en" data-carbon-theme="boomerang">
  ...
</html>
```

## Use

After you have the styles configured, you can then import components as you'd expect.

```js
import { UIShell } from "@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react";
```

> Note: In v3 of the component library we have removed the re-exporting of all of the Carbon components.

### Integrating with UIShell Notifications

We use [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) to create notifications for UIShell events. If you are using the UIShell and want to also use react-toastify in your app for own notifications, you need to configure your `ToastContainer` component to support [multiple containers](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/multi-containers/#multi-containers-support) via the `enableMultiContainer` prop. It is _NOT_ required to include a `containerId` on your container or with notifications that you create. Without multi-container support enabled, you will see two notifications created for UIShell events.

## ðŸ›Ÿ Version 2 LTS

Because of the potential time and difficulty involved in a migration to Carbon v11, we will maintain a maintenance v2 of the component library for a period of time. It will recieve critical functionality and security updates. Please view the support table below.

## Support Schedule

| Release | Status          | End-of-life |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| v1      | **End-of-Life** | 2022-03-18  |
