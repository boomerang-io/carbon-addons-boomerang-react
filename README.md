# Carbon Addons Boomerang React [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ebf40744-c9a5-4c91-a43d-e885b7e2da88/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/deploys)

[Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) addon components for Boomerang written in React. View the [Storybook](https://carbon-addons-boomerang-react.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add @boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react
```

## 3.0 Release

As of version 3.0, the team has decided to make major changes to our boomerang carbon add-ons. We have decided to follow a design change that is similar to that of the IOT team. With version 3.0, the styles and react components will be included in one package `@boomerang-io/carbon-addons-boomerang-react`. Also for added ease, we will now export our custom components along with the unmodified components from carbon-components-react.

- add ES Modules, CommonJS and UMD module formats to support wider range of component use cases
- include component styles with components to improve authoring and consuming DX
- export all Carbon components in addition to our custom components to improve consuming DX
- upgrade Storybook to latest major version and add additional addons
- add new custom components and rename exports for naming consistency
- include required Carbon packages as dependencies to simplify installation and prevent version mismatches

**Upgrading**

1. Remove `@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang`dependency

```bash
npm uninstall @boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang
```

2. Update scss styles import statement

```diff
- @import '~@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang/scss/styles';
+ @import '~@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/styles/scss/styles';
```

3. You're done!

## Using

You need to import the `.scss` styles. If you are using SASS and webpack, perform the following import.

```css
@import '~@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react/styles/scss/styles';
```

You can then import components by the following:

```js
import { Header } from '@boomerang/carbon-addons-boomerang-react';
```

## Testing a version

Often times it is useful and necessary to test a published version of the component library via an application that uses it. Linking the project locally isn't always enough of a guarentee.

We host the npm package for the library on Artifactory. Unlike the npm registry, we can't [tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag.html) a version to control the distribution e.g. designating a version as a beta. In Artifactory, whatever has the highest SemVer becomes the latest by default. Their [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag.html) provide more information. To prevent unwanted versions from becoming the latest we following the convention of shifting all of the versioning numbers `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to the `.PATCH`. For example, a new version of `3.4.0` would become `0.0.340`. It's not foolproof, but it works for our situation and is easy enough for developers to do.

## Integrating with UIShell Notifications

We use [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) to create notifications for UIShell events. If you want to also use the library in your application for notifications you must configure your `ToastContainer` component to support [multiple containers](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify#multi-container-support) via the `enableMultiContainer={true}` prop. It is _NOT_ required to include a `containerId` on your container or with notifications that you create. Without multi-container support enabled, you will see two notifications created for UIShell events.
