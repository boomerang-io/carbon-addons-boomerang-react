Hi there! üëã Hope everything is going okay using the Carbon Addons
for Watson IoT components. It looks like you might have a question
about our work, so we wanted to share a couple resources that you could
use if you haven't tried them yet üôÇ

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- #iot-pal for questions about the Watson IoT Pattern and Asset Library (PAL)
- #iot-pal-components for questions about components, usage of this repository

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling in the details below.

-->

### Summary

Please describe your question in one or two sentences.
